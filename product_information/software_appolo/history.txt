  the "Contrast" slider would not be enabled in the GUI as expected.

- Fixed bug #832
  In the GUI of PVD 3010, the external AES connections would be shown as
  "enabled" if only option P_VD_MXDX was active. In fact, the external
  AES connections are active only on option P_VD_AP. The display in the

- Added User Interface for SVD 5412
  (ASI Change Over Switch)

- Completely rebuilt the Analog Deembedder GUI
  (Products PDX 3010, CDX 5024, CDX 5624) for more intuitive
  user interaction and clearer presentation of device capabilities.

- Store Backup-Data in an installation independent location, so
  that they do not get lost on a de-/re- installation of the software.
  All Backup-Data is now stored in a directory similar to
  C:\documents and settings\all users\application data\Lynx\c3_local\device_backup
  (exact directory names depend on MS-Windows language settings)

- re-formatted the Logfile-entries about device-specific events to
  describe the reporting device (name and position) as human readable
  text.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #760: Restore a Backup-Set into multiple MiniModules fails
  with timeout. When restoring a Backup-Set spawning multiple
  MiniModules (in a RFR 3010, requires SW-license RSL_BR20 or
  RSL_BR30), then a certain percentage of Device-Items would always
  end up in a "restore failed on timeout" state.

- Fixed bug #762: In the GUI of the DAD 5220, the individual input
  channel status indication was always green ("present"), even if no
  input signal was connected at all. This was a pure presentation
  issue. The master-LED (module and GUI) was correct at all times.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- In the GUI of the CDX 5624: correctly support switching to "S-Video"
  on the analog video output.

- Fixed bug: On relatively slow machines, removing a Device
  immediatley after it had just been detected by the system could lead
  to a situation where the device was never removed from the
  system. This has been fixed now.

- Fixed bug: Under very rare circumstances it could happen, that a
  device is not shown in the tree-graph although it has correctly been
  detected (as can be seen in the logfiles). This was a bug in the
  presentation logic. Fixed now.

- Significantly reduce network traffic and server CPU load when
  logging into a remote server (RCT 5030). This improvement is only
  available when client and server are both using version 3.4.1 (or
  above).

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed PTG 3610 (Testor) GUI: The PTG 3610 (Testor) GUI was not
  always showing the correct list of available patterns/sequences,
  especially when multiple such modules were in the system.
  Also: the Sync/Video delay was not displayed reliably.

- Fixed bug #754: DVD 5420: Master LED in GUI sometimes not correct.
  The Master LED color of a DVD 5420 in the GUI/RCP 5000 is sometimes
  not correct (according to master LED on the module)

- Fixed connection bug: when a server was restarted (e.g. because it
  was being re-configured) while a client was just logging in, the
  client (here: c3-local) would appear to be locked for a long time
  (depending on number of devices at that server), before resuming
  normal operation. Now the client returns to the "disconnected" state
  within very short time, as expected.

  in certain (very few) textual entry fields.

- Fixed the internal ftp client to properly close the connection
  before disconnecting from the server.

- Fixed issue in the VideoADC-GUIs: The "Y-shaping filter" selection
  would be displayed as "unknown" as long as there is no valid input
  signal. With this fix, setting the "Test pattern Standard" to
  "525"/"625" works around this inconvenience.

- Fixed bug #681: PTG 3010/PTG 5010 Text insert cannot be switched on
  In the GUI of the PTG 3010/PTG 5010 there is a checkbox missing that
  enables the insertion of text. The text can be entered, but it
  is never overlayed to the video output.

- Fixed bug #686: AudioADC: ChannelID can only be set to one character
  In the GUI of all Audio AD-Converters, the ChannelID can only be
  set to one character.

- Fixed bug #688: DVA 5110: status LED color in UI sometimes not correct
  In the UI (GUI/RCP 5000/...) the color of the status LED of theDVA 5110
  was sometimes not correct (i.e. not same color as LED on the board itself)

- Fixed bug #693: PTG 3010/PTG 5010: Inserted Text filled to 8 chars with squares.
  When entering a text of less than 8 characters for overlay, the
  original text was implicitly filled with square-symboles to fill
  the available 8 characters in the SDI.

- Fixed bug: At the time a (RCT 5030) server becomes available in the

  internal processing.

- Fixed bug #626: "PDX 3010: Assignment of outputs not possible in GUI"
  The GUI of the PDX 3010 would not allow correct assignments of
  AES putput channels to channels.

- Fixed bug #632: MiniModule on ServiceAdapter was not recognized if
  Simulation mode had been activated before.

- Fixed bug #649: "strange UI status text if SVD 5012 in bypass"
  The status text in the user interface (GUI / RCP 5000) was confusing
  when the unit was running in "bypass mode".

- Fixed bug #658: "SDI input missing" event available for just one channel
  The Events-Tab in the GUI of the CAD 3002 showed only events for one
  of the two channels.

- Fixed bug #661: PTG 3010/PTG 5010: specifying shorter overlay text.
  When reducing a longer overlay text to a shorter one, the remaining
  characters would have to be explicitly specified as space-characters
  in order to delete them from the resulting overlay string. While
  this workaround worked ok, it is still inconvenient.

- Fixed bug #662: "PMX 3312/3313 does not show events of AudioADC"
  Input-lost Events from Audio-ADC combo are not shown in GUI of
  PMX 3312 / PMX 3313

  Replaced the block diagram for the DVA 3120 in the GUI, so that the
  DVA 3120L is also covered by the illustration.

- Fixed bug #677: "CMX 5110: Switching to Manual Gain not complete"
  Switching between "Auto-Gain" and "Manual-Gain" (luminance and/or
  chrominance) in the GUI of the CMX 5110 did not complete all required
  internal changes. Some automatic behaviour remained in action.

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added Graphical User Interface for DVD 3620
  (MultiFormat HDTV/SDTV Dual Input SDI Distribution Amplifier
   with 2x4 crossbar)

- Introduction of the new Remote Control Interface. All devices can be
  controlled by an external application through the LYNX remote
  control interface. This is a simple ASCII-based protocol over UDP/IP
  that allows a third party application / script to control any
  setting in the LYNX control system. A copy of the detailed
  description of this remote interface can be requested with a short
  email to support@lynx-technik.com.

- The application is guaranteed to be started only once on a
  computer. The attempt to start it a second time will simply bring
  the already running instance to the foreground, propagating
  command line options as appropriate (see below).

- New commandline option -select can be used to request that the
  application selects the GUI of a specific module (by position). The
  actual position has to be specified using the addressing scheme of
  the Remote Control Interface.
  Example, adressing local COMport 1, stack 0, frame 1, slot 5:
  c3_local.exe -select <local>:0.0.1.5
  Example, adressing remote COMport 1, stack 4, frame 0, slot 7:
  c3_local.exe -select 192.168.1.160:0.4.0.7

- New commandline option -popup offers similar capabilities as option
  -select (described above). The requested GUI page will be displayed
  in a separate popup-window instead of the main window. This allows for
  control of multiple devices at once. After application startup, any
  Device-GUI can be sent to a new popup window through the appropriate
  option from the "Device" pulldown menu.

- The passwords for a remote connection (to RCT 5030) can optionally be
  *not* stored persistently. If this option is activated, the password
  needs to be re-entered every time the connection is used.

- Leaving a textual entry field in the GUI by TAB-key or by clicking
  the mouse outside the entry field applies the new value to the
  device. In older versions, the described action used to discard the
  new value and revert to the original value.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #602: sync source of CAD 5121/CAD 5122 is identical for both
  channels. The sync source of CAD 5121/CAD 5122 (intern/extern/off) is
  always identical for channels 1 and 2. The client display (PC-GUI /
  RCP 5000) was not guaranteed to be updated accordingly.

- Fixed bug #607: application can terminate when pressing F5 in
  GUI of PVD 5010 / RCT 5020 / RCT 5030

- Fixed bug #620: setting overlay text in PTG 3010 / PTG 5010 GUI does
  not work correctly. This bug existed in releases 2.6.2 and 2.6.3

- Fixed bug #626: PTG 3010: Assignment of outputs not possible in GUI
  clicking one of the radio-buttons to re-assign outputs would jump
  back to the original position after ~2 seconds.

- Fixed bug #629: CDA VideoDA-Converters: YLevel Betacam leads to wrong UVLevels.
  On the Gain-Page ofall CDA VideoDA-Converters: Setting the YLevel to
  "Betacam" lead to wrong UVLevels. Now the "Betacam" YLevel makes the
  UVLevels read-only and implicitly sets them correctly.

- Fixed bug #632: Initialization of serial port does not init all parameters
  Under certain cirumstances, the code that initializes the serial
  ports (COM1...8) does not make all required settings in a 100% correct
  way. This can lead to communication failures, such as slow response
  or inconsistent display of current status of individual boards.

- Fixed bug: Display of false temperature/voltage peak values for PSUs.
  The temperature and voltage displays of the PSU units could display
  false peak values due to data transmission errors. These errors are
  now filtered out and prevented from display.

LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.6.3 (build 140, 24.June.2005)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #604: incorrect read of data from the PAD 5212 could lead
  to wrong display values on the client (c3_local / rcp). NOTE that
  this bug is in the server part of the software. I.e. if the c3_local
  is connected to the PAD 5212 through a RCT 5030 per LAN, then the
  appropriate patch- release 2.6.3 needs to be installed in the
  RCT 5030 also.

- Fixed bug #605: Under certain conditions, modifying a value on the
  GUI could lead to instability in the client-part of the
  software. This issue exists only in the user interface. The signal
  processing devices are not affected.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.6.2 (build 139, 21.June.2005)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #601: "F5-Update of version info of Controllers incorrect"
  Pressing F5 in the GUI of the RCT 5010 / RCT 5020 / RCT 5030 would lead
  to an incorrect display of the version information in the GUI.

- fix bug that would cause the device tree to display an incomplete
  list of devices from a remote server (RCT 5030) under heavy network
  load. Now the list will always be completed after a couple of
  seconds, depending on available network resources.

- fix bug that would intermittendly logout the GUI from a remote
  server every once in a while. This was dependent on general network
  traffic and a relogin would be done immediately. Fixed now. A
  spontaneous logout happens only if the server cannot be reached for
  a significant amount of time.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.6.1 (build 138, 09.June.2005)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- New config variable GUI_EXPERT_MODE_PASSWORD can be supplied to
  protect access to the contents of the "Expert" Tab in individual
  device GUIs. The default is empty, which means that the "Expert" Tab
  is accessible by default.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #599: "Series 3000 modules behind RCT 5010 not displayed correctly"
  The tree display of Series 3000 modules behind an RCT 5010 would not
  be correctly sorted.

- fix bug in display of current status of SW options in GUI. Some
  SW options would be displayed as "not active" even if activated
  correctly.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.6.0 (build 137, 08.June.2005)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- General rework of major parts of the software architecture,
  resulting in a significant increase in overall stability and
  performance.

- More than one remote-server can be connected at the same time,
  even in parallel to devices on the local COM-ports.

- Enable the SIMULATION mode by default. The "local COM ports" panel
  in the GUI provides a checkbox named "Simulation". Enabling this
  option will simulate the complete product range of LYNX devices. The
  simulation includes the Event-Subsystem, so that Device-specific
  events can be simulated in all consequences. NOTE however, that
  there might be particular situations where the simulated device does
  not behave 100% like the real counterpart. Please contact you local
  representative in case of any questions.

- The GUI-layout (i.e. position of splitter lines) is persistently
  stored between sessions.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #590: "GUI CAD 5320: left/right indication crossed"
  The indication of input channel status was crossed between left and
  right channel on the GUI of the CAD 5320. NOTE: When using a RCT 5030
  (network connection, rather than local COM ports) you also need to
  update the RCT 5030 to version 2.6.0 for this issue to be gone completely.

- fix bug #594: "DVA 5120/DVA 3120: GUI initializes EQ sliders to wrong position"
  The GUI of the DVA 5120/DVA 3120 somtimes initializes the two EQ
  sliders to an incorrect position. This is a pure display issue; the
  actual values in the board are ok.

- fix bug #596: "PAD 5212: delay values are displayed as 16"
  The GUI of the PAD 5212 (when connected to remote RCT 5030) could
  display incorrect values for the msec-part of the delay and
  negative delay. This was a pure display problem of the GUI. The
  actual delay in the PAD 5212 was never changed in any way.

- fix bug #597: "PVD 5000/5005/5010/3010: slider values displayed at min/max"
  The GUI of the PVDxxx (when connected to remote RCT 5030) could
  display incorrect values for the video-parameter sliders on the main
  page. This was a pure display problem of the GUI. The actual delay
  in the PVDxxx hardware was never changed in any way.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.5.3 (build 134, 17.May.2005)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

  LEDs functionality ("show boards", "fixed pattern")

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug: "EQ slider in GUI for DVA 3120/DVA 5120/DVA 5110 clipping"
  The GUI for the various Analog Video DAmps (DVA 3120/DVA 5120/DVA 5110)
  had a bug in the handling of the Slider for the Equalizer value, that
  would reject any values > 50.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.4.1 (build 127, 21.Mar.2005)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #555: "c3-framework shutdown on CAD 3110"
  Some versions of the CAD 3110 shutdown the GUI. Fixed by
  eliminating a long-hidden bug in the framework.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.4.0 (build 126, 16.Mar.2005)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added Graphical User Interface for CAD 5135
  (12 Bit Video Analog Component to Digital Converter)

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.3.0 (build 125, 14.Mar.2005)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added Graphical User Interface for CAD 3100
  (12 Bit Video Analog Composite to Digital Converter)

- Added Graphical User Interface for PDX 5212 / PDX 5214
  (Digital AES Deembedder, 2/4 Channel)

- Added Graphical User Interface for PDX 5312 / PDX 5314
  (Analog Audio Deembedder, 2/4 Channel)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #530: DVD 5002 "GUI's Input colour in single channel always green."
  In the GUI the input indication in single channel mode is always green.
  The master LED color is correct though. Just the info text on the panel is
  not correct.

- fix bug #532: "CAD51xx: in 525 mode, Y-Comb filter selection is wrong"
  For all CAD51xx with ADV7189_02: In 525 mode, the available filter
  selection for Y-Comb is "no comb" and "2H". This is wrong. Should be
  "no comb" and "3H adaptive", same as offered in local menu (module
  edge).

- fix bug #535: "PVD50xx" GUI'S Master LED and current channel indication"
  The Master LED color in the GUI, as well as the indication of
  current channel in the GUI would not be accurate (i.e. in sync with
  HW-device) if the current input is controlled by GPI.

- fix bug #537: "login to RCT 5030 denied from a computer with multiple NICs"
  When c3_local is running on a computer with multiple network cards (NICs), it
  can happen that the wrong one is picked for network communication with
  the RCT 5030 (remote login). In this case, the IP-address of the correct
  network interface has to be entered into the file <config.txt> as
  parameter ORB_ENDPOINT. See comments in file <config.txt> for details.

- fix bug #554: "c3_local: possible dead-lock under heavy load."
  Under very heavy load, the c3_local can dead-lock. A restart is needed
  to return to normal operation.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.2.3 (build 118, 18.Jan.2005)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #502: "register update from server to GUI not reliable."
  It can happen that a spontaneous change of a register on the server is not
  reflected in the GUI. As a workaround, pressing the F5 key on the control-page
  for a specific device always forces an update of all controls to the correct
  current state.

- fix bug #503: GUI shutdown when renaming Stack/RCT 5020 (intermittent)
  Under some circumstances it can happen that the application may shutdown on an
  assertion violation when trying to rename a controller-type entry in the
  device tree (RCT 5030 / RCT 5020 / RCT 5010 / Stack).

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.2.2 (build 117, 17.Jan.2005)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #499: "GUI CAD 5121 / CAD 5122: init not complete"
  The GUI pages for the LEFT module in CAD 5121 / CAD 5122 would
  not be displayed correctly under certain init. circumstances.

------------------------------------------------
NOTE: when used with RCT 5030 (network login), this version of c3_local
requires c3_server RELEASE 2.2.1 on the RCT 5030. It can not be used
to login to an RCT 5030 running any older version of c3_server.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.2.1 (build 116, 17.Jan.2005)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #492: "devices not removed."
  A device would not be removed from the GUI after
  the physical removal from the system

- fix bug #493: "detection of devices *very* slow"
  It took a long time after physically adding a device to the system,
  until the new device was visible in the GUI.

- fix bug #494: "Status LED of CAD 5010 (and other CAD*s) green"
  The GUI's status LED for certain variants of the CAD (VideoADC)
  would not follow the one on the device, but be green always.

------------------------------------------------
NOTE: when used with RCT 5030 (network login), this version of c3_local
requires c3_server RELEASE 2.2.1 on the RCT 5030. It can not be used
to login to an RCT 5030 running any older version of c3_server.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 2.2.0 (build 115, 12.Jan.2005)

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.14.0 (build 106, 15.Nov.2004)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added Graphical User Interface for SVD 3062
  (Input Switch)

- Added Graphical User Interface for PAD 5212
  (Audio Delay Line)

- Introducing the EventHandling subsystem.
  Individual Modules will generate Events from the onboard signal
  processing (such as "input signal lost" etc.). For each such event
  there will be an entry in the <logfile.txt>. There will also be an
  entry in the Log-Panel on the bottom of the GUI. The adding of entries
  to the GUI's Log-Panel can be disabled for individual events from
  individual modules (based on module type and position). These
  configurations can be done from the new "Events" tab that is now part
  of each Module's GUI.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #454: Video DA-Conversion Luminance filter "Extended"
  was not correctly initialized in GUI.
  This only affected the display in the GUI at GUI startup. Signal
  processing was not affected. This applied to GUIs of following devices:
  CDA 3000, CDA 3002, CDA 3010, CDA 5010, CDA 5005, PDX 3010, DVD 5002.

- Fixed bug #455: PTG 3010 / PTG 5010: Adjust Audio gain to <mute> does not work

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.13.3 (build 103, 19.Oct.2004)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added Graphical User Interface for PTG 5010 (Testsignal Generator)
  (graphics of backpanel and functional diagram are still missing)

- introduced new configuration variable COLLECT_MAINTENANCE_INFORMATION.
  This switch should only be set to TRUE (in C:\Program Files\Lynx\c3_local\config.txt)
  on specific request by LYNX service personel. It will generate a very
  large logfile.txt, which should be sent to service@lynx-technik.com
  for further analysis, together with a detailed description of the
  problem.
  NOTE that this switch will implicitly fall back to FALSE after running the
  application once. So you should (1) set this switch to TRUE, (2) run the
  application once and reproduce the problematic behaviour in question,
  (3) terminate the application, (4) collect all files named logfile.* from the
  installation directory and send them to service@lynx-technik.com, and finally
  (5) restart the application

- Allow overflow of numerical input value into next entry
  field. E.g. increasing a pixel delay beyond the max. number of
  pixels per line auto-increments the line-delay and sets pixels to
  0. This applies to all GUIs where applicable.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #429: block diagram of PVD 5010 was wrong

- Fixed bug #430: block diagram of PVD 5000 was wrong

- Fixed bug #439: intermittend: boards not displayed at startup
  There has been a similar bug before (#435). But although the symptoms
  are similar, these were independent bugs, thus independent bugfixes.

- Fixed bug #440: select video reference source in GUI CAD 5320 not available

- Fixed bug #444: GUI of CAD 5112 was missing the switch
  to choose between Linesync/Framesync mode.

- Fixed bug #447: GUI of PTG 3010: Delay adjustment wrong

- Fixed bug #448: PMX 3312/PMX 3313: change of state in analog input
  may shutdown PC-application

================================================================

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added support for AES gain and sample rate to PTG 3010 GUI.

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #435: sometimes no devices displayed at startup.
  This bug has been seen on at least two systems with version 1.13.0
  and 1.13.1 now. This problem does not seem to exist with pre-1.13
  releases.
  It turned out to be a compatibility problem with certain versions of
  the RCT 5020.

- Fixed bug #434: GUI CAD 3110: wrong color comb filter displayed as selected

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.13.1 (build 101, 20.Sep.2004)

  (AES & Analog Audio Multiplexer)

- In all GUIs: +/- push-buttons which increment/decrement numerical
  values are auto-repeating (click and hold to keep modifying)#

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- Fixed bug #399: Wrong FS level selection
  The GUI for CAD 3321 did not set the FS-Levels correctly in the module.
  (there was an implicit offset of 1, which would make it impossible to
  select the 20dBu setting)

- Fixed bug #396: GUI PVD50*: max. line-delay always depends
  on standard of channel 1

- Fixed bug #380: DAA 3320/DAA 5320 did not always display
  0dB in GUI after factory reset.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.12.3 (build 98, 10.Aug.2004)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added support for DVD 5020, HW-Version 2. Previous versions of
  the c3_local SW would also work with this new HW-Version of the
  DVD 5020, but the status LED in single channel mode would not
  show the correct color.

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.12.2 (build 97, 14.July.2004)

------------------------------------------------

- Fixed bug #374: c3_local GUI does not show page for DAD 5220

- Fixed bug #349: wrong error indication (left/right) with DAA 3320/DAA 5320

- Fixed bug #376: flashing 'locate' LED in the RCT 5020's GUI never turns off

- Fixed bug #377: Status LED does not correctly initialize
  to RED for some modules (e.g. CDA 5220)

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.11.0 (build 93, 28.May.2004)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Added support for RCT 5020 version 100 and above. This includes the
  Hotsync feature, Alarm configuration of Powersupply states and the
  functional assignment of the chain of 10 LEDs on the frontside of
  the controller board.

- Reworked the event notification mechanism. As a first visible
  consequence, there is a new tab in the Options-Configuration menu to
  select which classes of events shall be logged in the GUI's log-view
  (on the bottom of the screen).

  A certain event can come (ON) and go (OFF). Both of these states can
  be logged separately.

- The contents of the <logfile.txt> are formatted differently and
  a new <logfile.txt> is created on every new start of the
  application. A previous <logfile.txt> is renamed to <logfile.1.txt>,
  shifting a previous <logfile.1.txt> to <logfile.2.txt> etc. The
  upper limit of this logfile-history is configurable by
  LOGFILE_MAX_BACKUP (see config.txt for details)

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #352: PMX 3313 type not displayed correctly in GUI

================================================================
PATCH RELEASE 1.10.1 (build 92, 07.May.2004)

- Allow selection of input SDI 2 on GUI of PVD 5005 if device
  supports it

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.10.0 (build 91, 29.Apr.2004)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- Replaced the handling of serial ports (aka COM
  ports). Instead of switching between individual ports, you can now
  select one or more ports to be scanned for LYNX controllers (through
  the Options - Configuration menu). The maximum number of COM ports to
  be made available in that dialog can be configured by config variable
  LYNX_SERIAL_PORT_MAX (details in installation file config.txt)

- GUI CDA 5011: in 525 mode, the allowed range for phase
  adjustment (on the LineSync tab) is limited to values 0...3

- By default, an empty slot in a RackFrame is visualized
  as an <empty> line in the browser tree. This prevents the browser tree
  from changing its vertical size when modules are added/removed. The
  previous behaviour (empty slots do not appear at all) can be selected
  by toggling the appropriate entry in the drop-down menu "View".

------------------------------------------------
Fixes

- fix bug #344: GUI CDA 3002 shows gain-enable checkboxes
  (-> offering entrypoint to invalid operation modes)

================================================================
LYNX Desktop Controller - RELEASE 1.9.3 (build 90, 07.Apr.2004)

------------------------------------------------
New Features

- CDA 5011: add control for subpixel delay adjustment if SW-version >= 97

  circumstances, initializing (building up) the GUI for a particular
  device would send new values for all slider-controlled parameters
  to the device. Not sure how the current release 1.0 is affected by this.

- Fix bug that did not let the Desktop Controller Application
  start up if MS-Windows username contains spaces.
  (symptom was: application never starts, popup with "ORB initialization failed" message)

- Fix issue that (in MS-Windows version) the logfile would be created
  with simple 'line-feed' line endings (instead of 'carriage-return' - 'line-feed').
  This made it hard to read the logfile in the MS-Windows notepad-editor.
